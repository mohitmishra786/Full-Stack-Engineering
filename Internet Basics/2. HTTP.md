# HTTP

[HTTP Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZJNj-HHfII&t=59s)

## What is HTTP?
- HTTP is a plain text language.

## Status Codes

* `1XX` - Information
* `2XX` - Sucess
* `3XX` - Redirect
* `4XX` - Client Erros (like `404 NOT FOUND`), Here client is responsible for the error.
* `5XX` - Server Error (like `503 Server Not Available`), Here server is responsible for the error.

## Port Number

- Like http we also have `https`, `ftp`, `ssh` etc which have some port number assigned to it. 
- It is mainly done to distinguish between all these, as when we will search for something then how our computer will know whether to use `http` or `https`.

**Port Number assigned :-**

* `http` - 80 
* `https` - 443
* `ftp` - 21, `ftp` stands for File Transfer Protocol.
* `ssh` - 22, `ssh` stands for Secure Server Protocol.

**Note :-**
* When we will search for `https://google.com` then by default the search will be for `https://google.com:443`
* By all these port it doesn't mean that  `https` will not work with port number `234`, it will work but it is not which anyone will advise someone to do.  
## Firstly, know that:
- URLs are a type of URI
- URNs are a type of URI
- URCs are a type of URI
etc..

## URI 
 - A standard for identifying documents using a short string of numbers, 
letters, and symbols.
 - defined by https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986
 
Examples:
  - URLs
  - URNs
  - URCs
  - ...
 
--- 
## URL
 - Contains information about how to fetch a resource from its location.
 - Always start with the protocol
 - Can be relative

Examples:
 - http://example.com/mypage.html
 - file:///home/user/file.txt
 - tel:1-888-555-5555
 
--- 
## URN
 - Identifies a resource by a unique and persistent name, but doesn't necessarily tell you how to locate it on the internet. 
 - It usually starts with the prefix urn:

Examples:
 - urn:isbn:0451450523 to identify a book by its ISBN number.
 - urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66 a globally unique identifier
 
--- 
## URC
 - Points to meta data about a document rather than to the document itself. 
An example of a URC is one that points to the HTML source code of a page

Examples:
 - like: view-source:http://example.com/
