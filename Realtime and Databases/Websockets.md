# Websockets

- It is a persistent bidirection connection between client and server.

### What is the meaning of "HTTP does not persist"?

- When we say that HTTP does not persist, it means that HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that every request and response is independent of any previous request or response. In other words, HTTP does not remember any information about previous requests or responses, and each request is handled as if it were the first.

> The minute HTTP connection is done it closes, whereas Websockets stays open, they persists.
