# Cloud Computing

- Before the innovation of this technology, every company used to have their own server space. They used to have their own IT team to handle this server part.

- Now after the innovation, most just rent the server from Cloud Service Providers for some time.

**Virtualization** - Dividing a servers resources into virtual computers. In old time we need to buy/rent the entire 32 Core Intel Processors but now we can rent only 1 core if we need only that.

**Virtual Machines** - Digital version of a physical computer.

**VPS** - Virtual Private Server.
