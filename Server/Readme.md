## What is Server?

- Anything can be a server literally anything my phone, my computer.
- Reasoning behind previous statement is simple as Server is simply that which responds to requests, or we can say listens to input.
- Servers needs to be available 100% of time.

## Why can't we just run the simpleServer.js? // Why can't we just build an application based off my localhost running a server?

- **Availability** - It's not going to run forever. OS will need an update or i need to close my laptop. So, maybe our laptop aren't the best server.

- **Usability** - It is good for me to work as a single developer but what about YOU, How will you work on this? How will you run this server?

- **Scaling** - How will we scale this? Buying more laptops is not a good solution. Until you are too much rich
